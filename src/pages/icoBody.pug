    h1 ICO
    p SmartFair aims to build a borderless, transparent, and “shared” economy based on our ERC-20 token: LA2D. Our token can facilitate all value exchanges in the online sports prediction ecosystem.
    p Total Supply: 1 Billion, fixed, generally deflationary with replenishment.
    p Burning of LA2D: Half of our commission will be burnt, this rule ensures that the higher the turnover the more tokens we burn which reduces the total supply temporarily. This sends a signal to the market that we are doing well which should act as a support to the price of LA2D.
    p Minting of LA2D: At the end of a year, new tokens will be minted to restore the total supply to 1 billion. New tokens will be distributed to all “active” token holders and dApp users according to the total amount of turnover they have contributed in the current year.
